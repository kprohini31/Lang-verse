    "description": "Next.js is an open-source web development React-based framework created by Vercel, which is famous for its unique features such as Server-side rendering and enhanced SEO. It has some additional features such as data fetching utilities, dynamic API routes, optimized builds, etc. It is a framework built upon React, Webpack, and Babel. A traditional react application is rendered client-side whereas a Next.js application is used to create production-ready web applications. Learning Next.js requires knowledge of basic React and Web Development. The most popular use of Next.js is in making Landing pages and marketing websites. Also if we want our webpage to rank better on searches the inbuilt features of Next.js provide support for that functions. You would be wondering if Next.js require some basic knowledge of React and React is a popular front-end JavaScript library then why do we have to learn this not to go only with React.js? The main reason is that Next.js has big advantages over React.js, it fixes some common problems that arise in React development. React does not have built-in routing capabilities which means we have to depend on third-party libraries or build our own routing solution and Next.js solved our problem of routing.",
