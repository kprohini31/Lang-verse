    "description": "Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a 'batteries included' language due to its comprehensive standard library. Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020. Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. Python is used for web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. This is a deliberate design choice, and has been described as a 'batteries included' philosophy of Python. For web development, Python offers frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI. For data science and machine learning, libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn are widely used. Python's simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for beginners, while its power and flexibility make it suitable for complex applications.",
