    "description": "C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or 'C with Classes'. The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms. C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is standardized by the ISO/IEC 14882 standard for the language and the ISO/IEC 19047 standard for the standard library. C++ is used by millions of programmers in essentially every application domain. C++ is used heavily in systems software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, high-performance server and client applications, and entertainment software such as video games. C++ has influenced many other programming languages, most notably C# and Java. C++ is a complex language that can be difficult to master, but it offers a high level of control and performance that makes it suitable for a wide range of applications. C++ has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools, including the Standard Template Library (STL), Boost, and Qt, which make it easier to develop complex applications.",
