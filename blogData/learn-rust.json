    "description": "Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++ but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references. Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional. Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the Servo layout engine and the Rust compiler. Rust has been voted the 'most loved programming language' in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016. Rust's syntax is similar to C and C++, although many of its features were influenced by functional programming languages. Rust enforces memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its 'borrow checker' tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation. Rust also guarantees thread safety by preventing data races at compile time. Rust's memory safety guarantees are enforced at compile time, with no runtime overhead. Rust's type system and ownership model ensure memory safety and thread safety without garbage collection. Rust's ownership model is based on three main concepts: ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. Rust is used in systems programming, embedded systems, web development, and more. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Discord use Rust in production. Rust has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools, and its package manager, Cargo, makes it easy to manage dependencies and build projects.",
